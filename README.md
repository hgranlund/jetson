# Throughput

Throughput.JsonStream is a stream that transforms a object, that may include Readable streams or Promises, into a JSON string.

Optionally replacing values if a replacer function is specified or optionally including only the specified properties if a replacer array is specified.

## Install

```bash
npm install throughput --save
```

## API spesification

### JSONStream

```
new JSONStream(value[, replacer[, space]])
```

#### Parameters

- `value:` The value to convert to a JSON string. It my contain

- `replacer (Optional):`
  A function that alters the behavior of the stringification process, or an array of String and Number objects that serve as a whitelist for selecting/filtering the properties of the value object to be included in the JSON string. If this value is null or not provided, all properties of the object are included in the resulting JSON string.
- `space (Optional):`
  A String or Number object that's used to insert white space into the output JSON string for readability purposes.

  If this is a Number, it indicates the number of space characters to use as white space; this number is capped at 10 (if it is greater, the value is just 10). Values less than 1 indicate that no space should be used.

  If this is a String, the string (or the first 10 characters of the string, if it's longer than that) is used as white space. If this parameter is not provided (or is null), no white space is used.

#### Return value

A Readable stream that outputs a JSON string representing the given value.

#### Exceptions

Throws a TypeError ("cyclic object value") exception when a circular reference is found.

Throws a TypeError ("BigInt value can't be serialized in JSON") when trying to stringify a BigInt value.

### Description

**_JSONStream(value)_** is a Readable stream that outputs the JSON representing **_value_**.

- If a Readable stream has **_objectMode = true_**, each chunck/object til be stringified as a normal **_value_**.

- If a Readable stream has **_objectMode = false_**, it will be stringified as a string.

- If a Readable stream has a **_jsonType_** property, the resulting stream output with be stringified as that type. Available values are: **_raw_**, **_string_**, **_object_** and **_array_**. the values are available on **_JSONStream.jsonTypes_**.

- If the **_value_** has a **_toJSON()_** method, it's responsible to define what data will be serialized.

- **Boolean**, **_Number_**, and **String** objects are converted to the corresponding primitive values during stringification, in accord with the traditional conversion semantics.

- If **_undefined_**, a **_Function_**, or a **_Symbol_** is encountered during conversion it is either omitted (when it is found in an **_object_**) or censored to null (when it is found in an array).

- **_JSONStream()_** can also just return **_undefined_** when passing in "pure" values like JSONStream(function(){}) or JSONStream(undefined).

- All **_Symbol_**-keyed properties will be completely ignored, even when using the replacer **_function_**.

- The instances of **_Date_** implement the toJSON() function by returning a string (the same as date.toISOString()). Thus, they are treated as strings.

- The numbers **_Infinity_** and **_NaN_**, as well as the value **_null_**, are all considered **_null_**.

- All the other Object instances (including **_Map_**, **_Set_**, **_WeakMap_**, and **_WeakSet_**) will have only their enumerable properties serialized.

## Usage

```javascript
const { JSONStream } = require('throughput');

const jsonStream = new JSONStream({
  aPromise: Promise.resolve('A resolved text'),
  aStringStream: ReadableStream('A streamed value'),
  aObjectStream: ReadableObjectStream({ streamedObject: true }),
  arr: [1, '2'],
});
('');
jsonStream.pipe(process.stdout);
```

Output:

```json
{
  "aPromise": "A resolved text",
  "aStringStream": "A streamed value",
  "aObjectStream": { "streamedObject": true },
  "arr": [1, "2"]
}
```

### Streams with different **_jsonType_**`s

```javascript
const { JSONStream } = require('throughput');

const arrayStream = Readable.from(fibonacciGenerator(1, 9)):
arrayStream.jsonType = JSONStream.jsonTypes.array;

const rawStream = Readable.from(fibonacciStringGenerator(1, 9)):
rawStream.jsonType = JSONStream.jsonTypes.raw;

const stringStream = Readable.from(fibonacciGenerator(1, 9)):
stringStream.jsonType = JSONStream.jsonTypes.string;

const jsonStream = new JSONStream({
  arrayStream,
  rawStream,
  stringStream
});

jsonStream.pipe(process.stdout);
```

Output:

```json
{
  "arrayStream": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21],
  "rawStream": 1123581321,
  "stringStream": "1123581321"
}
```

### Practical example with Express

```javascript
const { JSONStream } = require('throughput');

app.get('/resource', (req, res, next) => {
  const jsonStream = new JSONStream({
    aValue: 'We define',
    aExternalHttpRequest: request.get('https://quotes.rest/qod'),
  })
  jsonStream.pipe(res),
  }
);
```
